# learning-kivy
This is a repo where I put what I have learnt about Kivy! I used this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMHK6NDVlCM&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kSJVMyYeOQ8CXJ3z1k7gHn

## Motivation
I wanted to learn about mobile development, and I recently did Python which I enjoyed. Hence why I wanted to learn about Kivy to explore!

## Tech/Framework Used
This is kind of self-explanatory ðŸ˜…. This project uses Kivy, which is a GUI framework in Python which can be used for making mobile apps.
